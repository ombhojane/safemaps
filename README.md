# SafeMaps - Accident Hotspot Analysis Feature

## Overview
The Accident Hotspot Analysis feature enhances the safety route planning capabilities of SafeMaps by identifying and analyzing locations with a history of accidents. This feature integrates with the existing street view analysis to provide a more comprehensive safety assessment of routes.

## How It Works

### Accident Hotspot Detection
- The system identifies potential accident hotspots along a route using LangChain.js agents.
- For each street view location, it queries for past 6 months accident history.
- The accident data is analyzed using the Gemini AI model to determine:
  - Accident frequency (low, moderate, high, or very high)
  - Accident severity (minor, moderate, severe, or fatal)
  - Risk factors contributing to accidents
  - Safety precautions specific to that location

### Integration with Street View Analysis
- Accident context is added to the street view image analysis.
- The Gemini AI model considers accident history when assessing risk scores.
- Street view locations with significant accident history receive higher risk scores.
- Overall route safety scores now include accident history as a factor.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components
1. **Accident Hotspot Service** (`accidentHotspotsService.ts`):
   - Performs web searches for accident history data
   - Uses LangChain.js agents to process and analyze search results
   - Returns structured data about accident history for specific locations

2. **Maps Service Integration** (`mapsService.ts`):
   - Enhanced to obtain address information for each street view location
   - Calls the accident hotspot service to get accident data for each location
   - Passes accident context to the street view image analysis

3. **Gemini Service Enhancement** (`geminiService.ts`):
   - Updated prompt to consider accident history data
   - Modified scoring system to account for accident patterns
   - Adds 5-25 points to risk scores based on accident frequency and severity

### Technology Stack
- **LangChain.js**: Framework for creating AI agents that perform web searches and analyze data
- **Google Gemini AI**: Advanced LLM for interpreting accident data and street view images
- **Dynamic Structured Tools**: Custom tools for web searches and data processing

## Usage
The accident hotspot analysis is automatically integrated into the route analysis workflow. No additional user actions are required to benefit from this feature.

When viewing a route:
1. The system analyzes street view images along the route
2. For each location, it retrieves and analyzes accident history data
3. The final risk assessment includes both visual safety factors and accident history
4. Users see safety recommendations that account for known accident patterns

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with official traffic accident databases
- Temporal analysis of accident patterns (time of day, day of week, seasonal patterns)
- Machine learning models to predict accident likelihood based on visual features and historical data
- User reporting of unsafe conditions and near-miss incidents
