# Accident Hotspot Analysis Implementation Notes

## Components Implemented

1. **AccidentHotspotService** (`src/services/accidentHotspotsService.ts`)
   - Created LangChain.js integration for accident hotspot analysis
   - Implemented web search tool for finding accident history
   - Added Gemini model integration for analyzing search results
   - Created structured response format for accident data
   - Implemented error handling and fallback responses

2. **Maps Service Enhancements** (`src/services/mapsService.ts`)
   - Added address lookup for street view locations using reverse geocoding
   - Integrated accident hotspot data into street view analysis
   - Updated the fetchStreetViewImages and analyzeRoute functions to handle accident context
   - Added helper functions for calculating headings and handling points

3. **Gemini Service Updates** (`src/services/geminiService.ts`)
   - Enhanced street view image analysis to consider accident history
   - Added accident context parameter to analysis functions
   - Updated scoring system to include accident history as a factor
   - Modified prompts to consider accident frequency and severity

4. **Type Definitions** (`src/types/index.ts`)
   - Added new fields to StreetViewLocation interface for accident data
   - Added formattedAddress and accidentContext properties

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Data Collection**
   - Using LangChain.js Dynamic Structured Tools for data gathering
   - Web search tool to find accident history for specific locations
   - Reverse geocoding to get structured address information

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Using Gemini AI to analyze accident data from web searches
   - Structured format with frequency, severity, risk factors, and precautions
   - Integration with existing street view analysis pipeline

3. **Integration Approach**
   - Accident data flows as context into street view image analysis
   - Risk scores are adjusted based on accident history
   - Final route analysis includes both visual safety assessment and accident history

## Testing Approach

When testing this feature:

1. Verify that address lookup works correctly for street view points
2. Check that accident data is being fetched and formatted properly
3. Ensure accident context is passed into the Gemini analysis
4. Verify that risk scores reflect the presence of accident history
5. Confirm that the final route analysis mentions accident hotspots

## Technical Notes

- Used the latest LangChain.js libraries (v0.3.x)
- Direct integration with Google Generative AI for Gemini model
- Created mock web search to simulate real-world data fetching
- Structured the code to allow for future enhancements
- Maintained type safety throughout the implementation

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. Real web search API integration (Google, Bing, etc.)
2. Official traffic accident database connections
3. Enhanced accident pattern recognition
4. Caching of accident data for frequently analyzed locations
5. User-reported accident data integration
